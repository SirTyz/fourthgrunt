<h3>What is this app?</h3>
<p>This app serves as a "database" of sorts for my campaign. I have searched for campaign organization tools, but nothing has fit my method of sandbox, on-the-fly style of play. Most planning methods require tons of investment, and when the time comes to play the game, alot of time is wasted searching through your notes or program trying to find out what they players will encounter next. This app is meant to be a way to bypass the searching process, and allow the user to have instant access to the world's different elements on the fly and dynamically via a search bar and filter system.</p>
