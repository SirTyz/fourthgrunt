<h3>What is this app?</h3>
<p>This app serves as a "database" of sorts for my campaign. I have searched for campaign organization tools, but nothing has fit my method of sandbox, on-the-fly style of play. Most planning methods require tons of investment, and when the time comes to play the game, alot of time is wasted searching through your notes or program trying to find out what they players will encounter next. This app is meant to be a way to bypass the searching process, and allow the user to have instant access to the world's different elements on the fly and dynamically via a search bar and filter system.</p>

<h3>What is "Estaria"?</h3>
<h4>Intro</h4>
<p>Estaria is a massive, versitile, modular, well-doumented, continuous, sandbox, hexcrawl, Dungeons and Dragons 5E setting created by Tyler. The setting of Estaria is a lawless wasteland controlled by those who have access to the most power. Magic runs rampant and causes terrible darkness to spring forth out of the earth. The world is ancient and filled with hundreds of important and valuable artifacts. Estaria is a lush duo-continent world that is full of sinister beasts and creatures. Very few venture out to explore and out of those that do, very little come back, making this world harsh and unforgiving. 100% of my effort has gone into the central northern realm known as The Far Weald. A place where only the bravest or the stupidest would travel.</p>

<p>The Far Weald is ancient and mysterious; dotted with forgotten ruins, relics, and powerful demigods known as Ascendants. The few people that do actually call the Far Weald their home are hearty, tough, and are often harsh to outsiders. The one and only officially recognized settlement is known as Marriwald, and is in the mid east region of the realm. Though there is only one officially recognized city, the Far Weald is peppered with all sorts of small villages and settlements. The Weald has only be recently “discovered” in the passed several hundred years, by the “civilized” people. The civilized peoples range in all types. Humans, Dwarves, Elves, Halflings, and Gnomes are all welcomed and accepted in the civilized society.

<p>Those who originally lived in the lands of The Far Weald, have been called Skraelings by those who consider themselves the more “civilized”. The Skraelings have a very tribal culture and frequently use dark magics in their rituals. This makes them quite off-putting to those who consider themselves one of the civilized peoples. This combination of different peoples occasionally causes rise to conflict. Most of the time though, the people of The Far Weald are too busy to worry about other tribes and villages.</p>

<p>The beasts, monstrosities, aberrations, and other foul and dark beings in The Far Weald are plenty and abundant. A very small percentage of the population will actually leave the walls of their home towns and villages for fear of the very real possibility of a slow, sinister death at the hands of one of the many vile creatures from the wilds.</p>

<h4>Slavery</h4>
<p>When the civilized began to settle The Far Weald, they brought their Dragonborn and Orcish slaves with them. All but the richest of families have freed their slaves out of the harshness of The Weald. Very few are able to feed themselves, let alone be responsible for a large, hungry, slave.</p>

<p>Orcs, being naturally drawn to a more tribal life style, moved into the wilds and quickly became feral and hostile creatures. Because of the nature of the Orcish tribes, many human and elvish travelers may end up giving birth to a Half-Orcish child. In the rest of the world, Half-Orcs are considered monstrosities and many are left to die in the streets, but in the Far Weald, these children are accepted in as paragons of war and protection for the villages they are raised in.</p>

<p>Unlike the Orcs, the Dragonborn have implanted themselves deep into the government and lifestyle of the civilized areas of The Far Weald. Many of them becoming well known traders, nobles, and adventurers. Some of the more radical types of Dragonborn feel a call to return to their dragon roots and will travel into the wilds to find a dragon lord to worship and serve.</p>

<h4>The State of Magic</h4>
<p>Magic in The Far Weald is abounding and wild. Many people have taken up magic in order to better their society like Wizards and Clerics. There are some people that have had roots in The Far Weald long enough that they are born with innate magical affinity, these people are known as Sorcerers. Though magic may be wide spread and moderately accepted, there are some who practice the deep magics that few dare to speak of and are cast out of society due to fear. Warlocks, Witches, and rogue wizards known as Necromancers that dabble in the realm of the dead, have all been branded as either dangerous, crazy, or evil. Of course there are dozens of villages that scatter the landscape of The Far Weald that care not about the type of magic that one uses, and many even prefer the deeper, more ancient magic.</p>

<h4>Religion</h4>
<p>An unknown amount of gods are worshiped in The Far Weald. Many of these gods are ancient demons, monstrous dragons, or even bizarre plant life. In the civilized towns and villages there is a strong trend towards a pantheon of gods known as the 12 Angels of Creation. These beings have thousands of years of lore and history attached to them and are said to be the oldest, continuously practiced religion in Estaria.</p>

<p>The Skraelings and other towns on the fringe of civilized society, reject the 12 Angels, and prefer to worship more tangible beings known as Ascendants. These creatures and beings are scattered across The Far Weald. All of the Ascendants have their own agenda and plan, and use mortals to enact this plan for them. The Ascendants are just as much a part of the land as a mountain or a tree would be. They are supernaturally bound to certain regions of the world and are unable to explain why, making the need for worshipers vital for their plans to come through to completion.</p>
