<h1>Welcome to The Far Weald!</h1>
<p>The Far Weald is a massive, versitile, modular, well-doumented, continuous, sandbox, hexcrawl, Dungeons and Dragons 5E setting created by Tyler. The setting of The Far Weald is a lawless wasteland controlled by those who have access to the most power. Magic runs rampant and causes terrible darkness to spring forth out of the earth. The world is ancient and filled with hundreds of important and valuable artifacts. Life is not easy, but for those who wish to enter it, The Far Weald provides much reward.</p>

<h3>About this app</h3>
<p>This app serves as a "database" of sorts for my campaign. I have searched for campaign organization tools, but nothing has fit my method of sandbox, on-the-fly style of play. Most planning methods require tons of planning, and when the time comes to play the game, alot of time is wasted searching through your notes or program trying to find out what they players will encounter next. This app is meant to be a way to bypass the searching process, and allow the user to add things to the database in their planning time, then give them access to their creations on the fly and dynamically via a search bar and filter system.</p>
